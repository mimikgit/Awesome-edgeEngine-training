# üöÄ A 3-Day hand-on Training Course

## üìö Training goal 

Welcome to awesome_edgeEngine TrainingThe overarching goal of this 3-day hands-on training led by  with mimik technology instructors and field engineers is to empower 
participants with a comprehensive  understanding of Hybrid Edge Cloud (HEC), edgeEngine, and  essential development tools. Through this exploration, participants will learn how to use mimik technology  to create effective solutions by establishing serverless communication among  edgeEngine-enabled devices.

## Training Overview 

Day 1 focuses on introducing the principles of HEC and setting up the required development environments and tools. Day 2 delves into the practical application of
developer tools and an in-depth analysis of edgeEngine  functionality. Day 3 culminates in evaluating HEC solutions and hands-on exercises to apply the understanding in 
establishing discovery, connection, and communication between edgeEngine-enabled devices. This progressive learning journey equips participants with the skills and knowledge to innovate and create real-world solutions using mimik technology in the field of edge computing.
