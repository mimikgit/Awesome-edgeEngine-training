# üöÄ A 3-Day hand-on Training Course


## üìö Training goal 

Welcome to awesome_edgeEngine Training. The overarching goal of this 3-day hands-on training course with mimik technology is to empower participants with a comprehensive understanding of Hybrid Edge Cloud (HEC), edgeEngine, and essential development tools. Through this exploration, participants
will learn how to use mimik technology to create effective solutions by establishing serverless communication among edgeEngine-enabled devices.


## Training Overview 

Day 1 focuses on introducing the principles of HEC and setting up the required development environments and tools. Day 2 delves into the practical application of developer tools and an in-depth analysis of edgeEngine  functionality. Day 3 culminates in evaluating HEC solutions and hands-on exercises to apply the understanding in establishing discovery, connection, and communication between edgeEngine-enabled devices. This progressive
learning journey equips you with the skills and knowledge to innovate and create real-world solutions using mimik technology in the field of edge computing.
